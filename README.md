## What is Dina Game Engine?

**Dina Game Engine** is a visual editor designed for C# developers who want to create 2D games with [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) and the [DinaCSharp](https://dinacsharp.lacombedominique.com) framework — without giving up control of their code.

The editor generates clean, structured C# code that stays fully editable in Visual Studio. No black box, no lock-in.

Built with **WPF / .NET 10**, targeting **Windows only**.

## ✨ Editor Features (v0.7.0)

- **Project management** — Create, open, and manage game projects. Recent projects grouped by date with icons, path, last access time, and pin support.
- **Scene editor** — Add and filter scene components. Component type selector via contextual add menu. Scene preview panel is work in progress.
- **Color palette management** — Add, edit, and delete named colors. Changes are automatically reflected in `PaletteColors.Designer.cs` in the game project.
- **Font management** — Add, edit, and delete named fonts with TTF file selection. Multi-resolution SpriteFont files are automatically generated for all supported resolutions (720p to 2160p) with proportional size calculation. Changes are reflected in `FontKeys.Designer.cs` and `FontContent.mgcb`.
- **Code generation** — Partial class system separating auto-generated Designer files from user-editable files. Zone markers ensure safe incremental updates without overwriting user code.
- **Multi-view navigation** — Tab bar with closable tabs for working across multiple editors simultaneously.
- **Localization** — The editor is currently available in French and English. Additional languages can be contributed by providing translations.

## 🏗️ Editor Solution Structure

| Project | Role |
|---|---|
| `DinaGameEngine` | WPF application — Views, ViewModels, converters, styles |
| `DinaGameEngine.Common` | Shared base classes: `ObservableObject`, `RelayCommand`, `ILogService` |
| `DinaGameEngine.Models` | Data models: `GameProjectModel`, `SceneModel`, `ColorModel`, ... |
| `DinaGameEngine.Abstractions` | Service interfaces: `ICodeGenerator`, `IProjectService`, ... |
| `DinaGameEngine.Services` | Service implementations: `FileService`, `ProjectService`, ... |
| `DinaGameEngine.CodeGeneration` | Code generation engine: `CodeGenerator`, `SectionParser`, component generators |
| `DinaGameEngine.Templates` | Embedded game project templates |
| `DinaGameEngine.Updater` | Auto-update module |

---

## 🎮 Generated Game Project Structure

Each generated game is a standalone Visual Studio solution. `DinaCSharp.dll` is placed at the solution root and referenced by all projects automatically.

| Project | Role |
|---|---|
| `Fonts` | TTF font files and auto-generated SpriteFont variants for each supported resolution (720p to 2160p) |
| `Audio` | Sound effects and music content |
| `Assets` | Images and sprite resources |
| `Core` | Keys, data classes, palette colors, and shared game logic |
| `Scenes` | All game scenes |
| `[GameName]` | Main entry point, game loop, and configuration |

Project metadata is stored in `dina.project.json` at the game project root.

## 🏛️ Editor Architecture

| Aspect | Approach |
|---|---|
| Pattern | MVVM with manual dependency injection — no third-party DI framework |
| Base classes | `ObservableObject`, `RelayCommand` shared in `DinaGameEngine.Common` |
| Navigation | `NavigationService` centralizes all view transitions |
| Code generation | Partial class system with zone markers (`=[ZONE:...]=`) for safe incremental updates |
| Localization | Custom `TranslateExtension` markup extension backed by `.resx` resource files |

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Technology | Details |
|---|---|
| Language | C# / .NET 10 |
| UI Framework | WPF (Windows only) |
| Game Framework | MonoGame 3.8.4 |
| Game Library | [DinaCSharp](https://dinacsharp.lacombedominique.com) |
| Versioning | MinVer — semantic versioning via Git tags |

## 📋 Roadmap

The following features are planned for upcoming releases:

- [x] **Add font** — add new SpriteFont files with custom resolution variants
- [ ] **UI components** — place and configure UI elements in a scene visually
- [ ] **Scene editor** — visual canvas for placing and configuring scene components
- [ ] Auto-updater (DinaGameEngine.Updater)
- [ ] GitHub Wiki

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions, bug reports, and feature suggestions are welcome.
Please open an issue or submit a pull request.

Translation contributions are especially appreciated — the editor currently supports French and English, and each new language only requires a `.resx` file.
